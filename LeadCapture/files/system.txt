This is the file where you store your prompt for ChatGPT.
We are saving the prompt in a .txt file so it can be as long as possible,
without taking up unnecessary space in our views.py. 
It can be anything you want. You should save important business information in here that you want it to answer from, 
and any other aspects of its behavior.
